HyperSell is an app for receiving and sending orders/leads to WooCommerce stores
So in this part, we're using WooCommerce API
in your first entry to HyperSell Dashboard, we will redirect you to the WooCommerce panel to give us an Authorization
With this authorization, HyperSell can send the orders/leads that are received from the form to your WooCommerce store (this authorization includes reading and writing orders)
You can read all information about WooCommerce API from here <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/" target="_blank">WooCommerce API</a>.
